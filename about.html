                My name is Louis Bennette, I'm a recent graduate from the University of Liverpool. I graduated with a 2.1 degree in Software development.
                This website is a collection of projects I have done old and new. The site itself is a pet project of mine and has changed a fair amount over the years.

                If you are interested in me professionally, please feel free to take a look at my <a href="cv/CV - Louis Bennette.pdf">cv</a>.

                My project interests vary from pure software projects such as games or websites to working with hardware such as the arduino, raspi or even some custom electronics.
                If you are interested in some specific projects I have worked on please view my <a href="projects.html">projects page</a>.

                In my spare time I like to work on some small projects.
                I'm interested in home automation from a hobbyist's perspective, I've created a program that controls an led colour light from the system tray of my desktop. <link>

                My favorite sports are kayaking and swimming.
                I enjoy playing video games and I try to stay up to date with the latest game industry news and games.
